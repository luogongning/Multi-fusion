LV Volumes Prediction based on Multi-views Fusion CNN
Left ventricular (LV) volumes estimation is a critical procedure for cardiac disease diagnosis. The traditional estimation methods are mainly based on image segmentation technology. In this paper, we proposed a direct volumes prediction method based on the end-to-end deep convolutional neural networks (CNN). We study the end-to-end LV volumes prediction method in the items of the data preprocessing, networks structure, and multi-views fusion strategy. The main contributions of this paper are the following aspects. First, we proposed a new data preprocessing method on CMR. Second, we proposed a new networks structure for end-to-end LV volumes estimation. Third, we explored the representational capacity of different slices, and proposed a fusion strategy to improve the prediction accuracy. The evaluation results on the open accessible benchmark datasets prove that the proposed method has higher accuracy than the state-of-the-art prediction methods in terms of end-diastole volumes (EDV), end-systole volumes (ESV), ejection fraction (EF).
