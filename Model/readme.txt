In this folder, the imporved Deep learning models are given for testing the model performance and 
explore the characteristics of Networks.
The new networks can be created based on the base threes networks: Reset, Vgg, and googlenet.
For instance:
1. you can change the input dimensions according to actual input demensions.
2. you can change the kernel size in the first layers.
3. you can add some new layers such as the batchnormal layer.
